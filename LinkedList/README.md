Implemented the LinkedList Data Structure. 
Added method indexOf(Object o) which returns the index of the first occurence of the element o, or -1 if the element is not found.
Added method reverse() that flips the order of the list.
Added method removeDuplicates() that removes duplicate elements in the list.
Added method interleave(MyLinkedList<AnyType> other) that interleaves elements from the other list into the linked list. If other is longer than the current list its remaining elements are appendeded.
